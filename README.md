# Music Classification

This repository contains a project focused on classifying music using machine learning techniques and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to generate synthetic data.

## Project Structure
- data/: Contains the dataset.
- models/: Contains trained models.
- notebooks/: Jupyter notebooks for exploration and analysis.
- predict/: Some audios to test the model.
